                    <u>BLACK WALL STREET</u><br>
                    <br>
                    The street was lost in ‘21<br>
                    The KKK and Beelzebub<br>
                    Went down on Black Wall Street<br>
                    The kerosene paint did its job<br>
                    But not as well as the mob<br>
                    Way down on Black Wall Street<br>
                    And I know you cannot fall...<br>
                    They shot down mobs<br>
                    In their beds<br>
                    And strung them up<br>
                    Cold and dead<br>
                    Way back in 1921<br>
                    When it was said that they won<br>
                    The world wide war number one<br>
                    Laid down on Black Wall Street<br>
                    And I know you cannot fall<br>
                    And I know she was used to men to please<br>
                    She liked to take the sleaze<br>
                    She liked to terrorize<br>
                    Her feet were put to fire<br>
                    And I know...<br>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <u>CRACKHOUSE</u><br>
                    <br>
                    If you want to find a cure for being such a bore<br>
                    Well then you and I could be the best of friends<br>
                    Cos in the land of everything it’s hard to find a thing<br>
                    When you’re shopping at the local discount store<br>
                    And if you want to fight a lot and wage war on your friends<br>
                    Well that’s sure to be arranged before you die<br>
                    And if you want to find yourself and never be again<br>
                    Well there is a little place you could try<br>
                    Cos there’s a little crack house down on Philadelphia St.<br>
                    Where they don’t expect that much out of time<br>

                    <u>RUSSIAN BRIDE</u><br>
                    <br>
                    Got a gin and tonic on another rainy day<br>
                    Got a Russian bride and I know she’s on her way<br>
                    Gotta run, gotta bug you<br>
                    But I don’t fix<br>
                    I don’t fix a thing!<br>
                    Got a look up closer<br>
                    And another of your remarks<br>
                    Gotta lot of peaches<br>
                    And there ain’t no end in sight<br>
                    Gotta run, gotta find you<br>
                    But I don’t face<br>
                    I don’t face a thing!<br>
                    Got a gin and tonic<br>
                    And another rainy day<br>
                    Got a Russian bride<br>
                    And I know she’s on her way<br>
                    Hope I wake up sleeping<br>
                    Hope I wake up and you’re dead!<br>
                    I’ll wake up in your bed…<br>

                    <u>SOMEDAY</u><br>
                    <br>
                    I will never get to meet you<br>
                    I’ll be the one you cannot see<br>
                    I will let you down and I will pick you up again<br>
                    I will wait, crave away<br>
                    Another fix to save the day<br>
                    I will keep your picture by my bed<br>
                    Cos someday you’ll be dead<br>
                    And someday I’ll dead dead<br>
                    That’s right, the women are smarter...<br>
                    There’ll be time when we grow old<br>
                    To count the things that we have sold<br>
                    I will let you down and never pick you up again<br>
                    I will wait and fade away<br>
                    Another truth to save the day<br>
                    I will keep your picture by my bed<br>
                    And someday we’ll be dead...<br>
                    That’s right, the women are smarter!<br>

                    <u>THINGS ARE ONLY GETTING WORSE</u><br>
                    <br>
                    Things are only getting worse<br>
                    Humanity, yes it’s a curse<br>
                    Killing one another to make a dime<br>
                    Well I’m wasting all my time<br>
                    Yeah I’m wasting all my time...<br>
                    She looked like a healthy mother<br>
                    She had a criminal smile<br>
                    She knows she’s on my mind<br>
                    But I’m wasting all my time<br>
                    And I’m wasting all my time (it’s alright)<br>
                    Things are only getting worse...<br>

                    <br>
                    I had a friend named Rocco<br>
                    He lived in the back of a Scirocco<br>
                    Sells on the streets, but he’s a good man<br>
                    His kids gotta eat, but they got a new plan<br>
                    Parents drink in their car<br>
                    Competition at the local bar<br>
                    With quick reactions, chances are,<br>
                    If you’re in the mood, you’ll go far<br>
                    I had a friend named Rico<br>
                    Kept his habit incognito<br>
                    He disappeared into the gutter<br>
                    The thought alone makes me shudder<br>
                    Parents drink in their car<br>
                    Competition at the local bar<br>
                    With quick reactions, chances are,<br>
                    If you’re in the mood, you’ll go far<br>
