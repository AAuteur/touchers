# touchers
A tribute website to one of my favorite music-making entities, the Touchers!

This site is being built as a final capston project for Front End Web Development course of Code Louisville.

This website should pass the following Feature Requirements:
- A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu
- Use CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes
- Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout
- Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through

This project should also satisfy all of the Additional Requirements listed per the syllabus.
