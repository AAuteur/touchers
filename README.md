# touchers
A tribute website to one of my favorite music-making entities, the Touchers!

This site is being built as a final capston project for Front End Web Development course of Code Louisville.

This website should pass the following Feature Requirements:
- A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu
- Use CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes
- Use media queries to switch from a one-column mobile layout to a two or more column desktop layout
- Create a form that takes in at least two fields of information and validates input


This project should also pass all of the Additional Requirements listed per the syllabus.
